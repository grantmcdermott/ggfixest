#' @title Aggregates event-study treatment effects.
#'
#' @description Aggregates post- (and/or pre-) treatment effects of an
#' "event-study" estimation, also known as a dynamic difference-in-differences
#' (DDiD) model. The event-study should have been estimated using the `fixest`
#' package, which provides a specialised `i()` operator for this class
#' of models. By default, the function will return the average post-treatment
#' effect (i.e. across multiple periods). However, it can also return the
#' cumulative post-treatment effect and can be used to aggregate pre-treatment
#' effects too. At its heart, `aggr_es()` is a convenience wrapper around
#' `marginaleffects::hypotheses()`, which is used to perform the underlying
#' joint hypothesis test.
#' @param object A model object of class `fixest`, where the `i()` operator has
#' been used to facilitate an "event-study" DiD design. See Examples.
#' @param rhs Numeric. The null hypothesis value. Defaults to 0.
#' @param period Character string. Which group of periods are we aggregating?
#' One of "post" (the default), "prep", or "both".
#' @param aggregation Character string. The aggregation type. Either "mean" (the
#' default) or "cumulative".
#' @param abbr_term Logical. Should the leading "term" column of the return
#' data frame be abbreviated? The default is TRUE. If FALSE, then the term
#' column will retain the full hypothesis test string as per usual with
#' `marginaleffects()`. Note that this information is retained as an attribute
#' of the return object, regardless.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to `marginaleffects::hypotheses()`.
#' @seealso [marginaleffects::hypotheses()]
#' @return A "tidy" data frame of aggregated (pre and/or post) treatment
#' effects, plus inferential information about standard errors, confidence
#' intervals, etc. Potentially useful information about the underlying
#' hypothesis test is also provided as an attribute. See Examples.
